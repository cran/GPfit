GPfit v0.2-0 (Release date: 2014-06-24)
==============

Changes:

* Matern correlation function added to corr_matrix()
* In corr_matrix(), Gaussian correlation generalized to power exponential.
* Power exponential correlation with power=1.95 is now default for corr_matrix() and thus for GP_fit.
* Iterative approach to selecting the nugget implemented in predict.GP().
* In GP_fit(), the argument optim_start was added, to allow user-specified initial parameter values for optim(), in addition to those generated automatically.
